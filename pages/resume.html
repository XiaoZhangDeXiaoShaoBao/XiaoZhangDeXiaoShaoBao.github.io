								<h2>Spring Breeze</h2>
								<p class="subDetails">September 2014 - March 2015</p>
								<p>As the chairman of the Entrepreneurship Association, three of us sold more than 4,000
									radios this year, accounting for 2/3 of the whole school, and began to sell quilts
									and old books. Overall, everything went well and the wind was proud.</p>

								<h2>Hit Hard</h2>
								<p class="subDetails">September 2015 - March 2016</p>
								<p>It is unfortunate that this year, the old books were lost. The reason was that they
									did not see the big situation and were blocked by the school. Because of the bad
									reputation in the previous two years, they were resisted by the students. Although
									the quilt business recovered a little loss, it was a pity.</p>

							<h2>Vehicle Trajectory Prediction</h2>
							<p class="subDetails">April 2019 - Present</p>
							<p> <strong>Project Description: </strong>The project is carried out at the Changsha
								Intelligent Driving
								Institute. It mainly predicts the trajectory of other vehicles on the
								expressway with a predicted duration of 8 seconds, thus providing a basis for the
								self-vehicle path planning module. The algorithm is verified and judged by the data
								packets taken by the truck at the Changsha Ring Expressway.<br>
								<strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Review the
								literature, design prediction algorithms, implement in C++ code, use Python to process
								incoming packets, and write verification tools to compare different prediction
								algorithms.</p>

							<h2>QQ Communication System</h2>
							<p class="subDetails">Janruary 2018 - March 2018</p>
							<p> <strong>Project Description:</strong> The project is mainly composed of software
								engineering
								and network
								programming. It imitates Tencent's QQ and uses QT to implement it. <br>
								<strong>Responsibilities: </strong>The whole project is based on the software
								engineering method, starting from requirements
								analysis, summary design, detailed design, coding implementation, code testing and
								maintenance. Each step is written with detailed documentation, and the software design
								is completed according to the documentation. This greatly speeds up development
								efficiency. At the same time, this project also allowed me to master the network
								programming foundations such as C/S architecture and Socket socket programming, and
								further familiar with the application of QT. The project has been uploaded to my CSDN
								blog and GitHub and has received a lot of downloads.</p>

							<h2>Distributed Signal Light Control System</h2>
							<p class="subDetails">October 2017 - December 2017</p>
							<p><strong>Project Description:</strong> The system uses an STM32F103 chip as the main
								control unit and three
								STC89C52 single-chip microcomputers as the slave control unit, and realizes the module
								communication through the Zigbee module, thus distributing the status of the four signal
								lights of the intersection. The key of the project lies in the communication protocol.
								The definition of the signal lights does not have green flashing and coordination
								work.</br>
								<strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Responsible for programming the Zigbee module and
								three slave control
								chips. Design and writing of communication protocols and writing of development
								documents.</p>
